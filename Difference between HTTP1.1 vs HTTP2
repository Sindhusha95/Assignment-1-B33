1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages using hypertext links.
HTTP 1.1 version came to picture in 1997, since then the protocol was unchanged, but IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force) revised the protcol and released 
a newer version of HTTP i.e. HTTP 2.0 in the year 2015.
The basic difference between both is, there are many advance features  implemented in HTTP 2.0 , since HTTP 1.1 "practically" only allows one outstanding request 
per TCP connection. But with HTTP 2.0 we can have multiple request at a time.
So, Multiplexing multiple requests over a single TCP connection is an advantage out of many advantages in HTTP 2.0 together with HTTP headers compression, priority
and more intelligent packet streaming management. 
This results in reduced latency and accelerates content download on modern web pages.
